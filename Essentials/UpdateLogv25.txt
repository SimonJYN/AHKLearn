10/4/2017 Renamed the "Mixing Potion" Script to "Making Unfinished Potions"

18/2/2017 Fixed the "Thieving Men" Script, because it was unreliable since the men in the ardougne building don't have any unique colours, (Men were same colour as the building which caused issues) the script has now been changed to be used upstairs in the Falador Pub on the "Drunken Man"
